# Nortrix Labs

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-experimental-lightgrey)

Nortrix Labs is a technical workspace for exploring systems, infrastructure,
and foundational software components.

This organization hosts experiments, internal tools, and open-source projects
that focus on structure, reliability, and long-term maintainability.

Not all repositories are production-ready.
Some exist purely for research, learning, or reference.
